I am a scientist trained in computational linguistics, linguistic fieldwork, and language teaching. My current research focus is on [language evolution](https://www.unine.ch/evolang/home.html).

I've created and maintain several typological databases:

* [`phoible`](https://github.com/phoible/dev)
* [`bdproto`](https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto)
* [`segbo`](https://github.com/segbo-db/segbo)
* [`acqdiv`](https://github.com/acqdiv/acqdiv)

And some tools for research in comparative linguistics:

* [`Unicode cookbook`](https://github.com/unicode-cookbook/)
* [`segments`](https://github.com/cldf/segments)
