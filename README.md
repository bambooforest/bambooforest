I am a scientist trained in [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology), [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics), [linguistic fieldwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_documentation), and [language teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_education). My current research is funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://www.snf.ch) and focuses on [language evolution](https://www.unine.ch/evolang/home.html).

I've created and maintain several [typological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology) databases:

* [`phoible`](https://github.com/phoible/dev)
* [`bdproto`](https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto)
* [`segbo`](https://github.com/segbo-db/segbo)
* [`acqdiv`](https://github.com/acqdiv/acqdiv)

And some tools for research in [comparative linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_linguistics):

* [`Unicode cookbook`](https://github.com/unicode-cookbook/)
* [`segments`](https://github.com/cldf/segments)
